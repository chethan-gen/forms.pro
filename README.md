### **Frontend Tasks**
1. **Create the Signup Page UI**:
   - Design a form with fields for email, password, and an image upload input.
   - Add a “Submit” button to send the data to the server.

2. **Implement Frontend Validation**:
   - Ensure the email is in a valid format.
   - Validate that the password meets security standards (e.g., minimum length, special characters, etc.).
   - Check that an image file is selected.

3. **Send Data to the Backend**:
   - Use JavaScript (e.g., Axios or Fetch API) to send the form data as a multipart request to the server.

   - Use Node.js and Express.js to handle incoming requests.
   - Install and configure Multer for handling file uploads.

5. **Create API Endpoint for Signup**:

   - Use Multer middleware to handle the image upload and save it to a specific folder.

6. **Store Data**:
   - Save the email, password, and image file path to the server or a database.

7. **Send Response**:
   - Send a response back to the frontend, confirming successful signup or returning errors if validation fails.

   - Verify that image uploads are working correctly.

9. **Debug Issues**:
   - Fix any bugs or errors encountered during testing.
